<h2>Extremely Important Submission Rules</h2>

<p>
As noted, you will be graded on your homework interactively in your group.
However, the TA will pre-screen your submission, running an R script.
You must follow the rules exactly, <b>OR RISK NOT GETTING CREDIT.</b>
Here are the rules:
</p>

<ul>

<li> Your submission will be in the form of a <b>.tar</b> file, with naming
convention as in our 
<a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/172/172Syllabus.html">
course syllabus</a>. 

</li> <p></p> 

<li> You will make sure that when the TA's script unpacks that file, 
your <b>.R</b> files will be there, in the same directory from 
which the script ran.  No subdirectories.
</li> <p></p>

<li> Your code file names are 
<b>Problem1.R</b>,
<b>Problem2.R</b>, and
<b>Problem3.R</b>.  You must have no other files.
</li> <p></p> 

<li> The code in those files will be directly runnable; upon being read by
<b>source()</b>, your code will execute, including plots if any.
</li> <p></p> 

<li> Remember, your code will run on the TA's machine, or possibly CSIF,
<b>NOT YOUR MACHINE</b>.  So your code cannot use any special
environment that you have on your machine.  You may use any packages
that are in the R installation on CSIF, as well as those listed below,
but no others.  And avoid the temptation to use a package that does not
appreciably reduce your development/debugging time; package bloat is the
root of all evil. :-)
</li> <p></p>

</ul>

<p>
Here are details on the TA's script (he could share it with you if he
wants):
</p>

<ul>

<li> 

In the same directory from which the script is run, the TA will have the
MovieLens data, in the <b>Hwk1.RData</b> file.  The contents are
the data frames <b>ml100</b> and <b>ml100kpluscovs</b> from 
our book.

</li> <p></p> 

<li> 
For the graphics problems, the base R plotting facilities are fine.  But
the TA will make sure the <b>ggplot2</b> and <b>lattice</b> packages are
loaded too, if you wish to use them.  (I generally like the colors in 
the latter more.)
</li> <p></p> 

<li> The script, entirely R code, will be something like this:
<p></p>

<pre>library(ggplot2 
library(lattice) 
library(rectools)
library(regtools)

load('Hwk1.RData')

for (f in dir(pattern='*.tar')) {  
   system(paste('tar xf',f))
   for (i in 1:3) {
      source(paste0('Problem,i,'.R'))
      readline('hit Enter when ready')
   }
}
</pre>

</li></ul>

<h2>Generality</h2>

<h2>A Note on the Role of Programming</h2>

<p>
ECS 172 is <i>not</i> a programming course.  You should find the coding
in our course to be quite straightforward, not challenging.  The
programming serves as a tool for data analysis, which is our goal.
</p>

<h2>Problem 1</h2>

<p>
Here you will explore how long individual user i waits between making
ratings, and the same thing for all users collectively.  Let's call
the means of those quantities
those quantities W<sub>i</sub> and W, respectively.
</p>

<p>
Write a function with call form
</p>

<pre>waitTimes(rawData)
</pre>

<p>
where <b>rawData</b> is a dataframe whose first column is user ID and
second is timestamp, e.g. the first and fourth columns of 
<b>ml100</b> in our book.  The return value is an R list,
with elements <b>individs</b> and <b>overall</b>, the first being a
vector consisting of the W<sub>i</sub> (in the order of user ID)
and the second consisting of W.
</p>

<p>
Note:  The first wait time is from the first timestamp to the second.
</p>

<p>
In order to make sure you know a variety of R constructs, there will be
two requirements:
</p>

<ul>

<li> Use this R idiom for finding differences of successive items in a
vector, making use of shifts:
<p></p>

<pre>&gt; x &lt;- c(3:5,12,13)
&gt; x
[1]  3  4  5 12 13
&gt; xLeft &lt;- x[2:5]
&gt; xLeft
[1]  4  5 12 13
length
&gt; xLeft - x[1:4]
[1] 1 1 7 1
</pre>

<p>
This vectorizes the differencing operation, much faster than a loop.
</p></li> <p></p> 

<li>
Write (and use) a function with this call form:
<p></p>

<pre>mergeEm(listOfVecs)
</pre>

<p>
Here <b>listOfVecs</b> is an R list, each element of which is a vector
sorted in ascending order.  The vectors need not be of the same length.
The return value is the merge of all the individual vectors, again in
sorted order, so that for instance element 22 is W<sub>22</sub>.
</p></li> <p></p>

<li> Note that this is to be a general function, usable in R in general.
None of the code should be specific to this assignment.
</li> <p></p> 

</ul>

<p>
Have your code conduct and print a test of <b>mergeEm()</b>
on a very small dataset.  Have your code run <b>waitTimes()</b>
on the full <b>ml100kpluscov</b> data, and print out the first 10
elements of each of W<sub>1</sub> and W; of course, <b>waitTimes()</b>
must make use of <b>mergeEm()</b>.
</p>

<h2>Problem 2</h2>

<p>
Are modern movie titles longer or shorter than in the past?  Is there
any time trend?  You'll explore that here, and gain some experience with
string processing.
</p>

<p>
The file <b>u.item</b> in the MovieLens <b>.zip</b> file contains
information about the movies, including title and year of release.
Write and run code to plot mean title length (in words) against release year.
</p>

<p>
You'll need to escape the apostrophes, using the option <b>quote=""</b>
in your call to <b>read.table()</b>.
</p>

<p>
Two strings will be considered words if they are separated by a blank or
other whitespace, e.g. commas.
</p>

<p>
The output is just the plot against time.
</p>

<h2>Problem 3</h2>

<p>
Do different movie genres have different rating patterns?  You will
explore this here.
</p>

<p>

Recall from your probability course that the <i>density function</i>
f<sub>X</sub>(t) of a continuous random variable X is a function that can be
integrated to obtain probabilities.  But the function itself, loosely
speaking, gives relative frequencies.  If say f<sub>X</sub>(28.8) is
large, then X often occurs near 28.8, or rarely so if the density is
small there.

</p>

<p>
In other words, a density is like a histogram, and in fact a histogram
is actually a sample estimate of the population density.
</p>

<p>
A nicer estimator is called a <i>kernel density estimator</i>.  Its
salient virtue is that it is a smooth curve, not choppy like a
histogram.  Since we are interested in multiple variables, for multiple
genres, the graph will be a lot less cluttered if we use kernel
estimators.  The analog of the histogram bin width is something called
the <i>bandwidth</i>, but we'll just take the default value.
</p>

<p>
Write a function with call form
</p>

<pre>plotDensities(inputDF,xName,grpName)
</pre>

<p>
Arguments:
</p>

<ul>

<li> <b>inputDF</b>:  Input data frame.
</li> <p></p>

<li> <b>xName</b>: name of the column in <b>inputDF</b> that we want to
draw "histograms" of
</li> <p></p>

<li> <b>grpName</b>: name of the column in <b>inputDF</b> to be used for
grouping; the function will group the <b>xName</b> data, and then
draw a "histogram" for each group; in our case, the groups are the
genres; the code will assume the grouping column is an R factor, showing
the first genre of that movie
</li> <p></p>

</ul>

<p>

The estimated densities will all be plotted on the same graph, in
different colors, and a legend showing which curve is which will be
displayed.

</p>

<p>
The variable X here is mean rating.  It turns out that there are 757
movies having genre 8.  After randomization due to movies possibly
having more than one genre, let's say there are 622 movies of genre 8.
So, you will plot an estimated density based 
on those 622 mean ratings.  One could draw a histogram of those 622
numbers, but it's nicer to draw a smooth curve.  And you will do the
same for each of the genres.  (So you can see why plotting histograms
would not be good; they would partially obscure each other.)
</p>

<ul>

<li> If in any row of the data there are
multiple genres, choose one at random, by calling sample().  
Set the other 1s in that row to 0s.
</li> <p></p> 

<li> Use either base R, <b>ggplot2</b> or <b>lattice</b>.  Tons of
tutorials on the Web.  If you don't use base R, remember to call
<b>library()</b> or <b>require()</b> at the start of your function.
</li> <p></p>

<li> Use either base R's <b>density()</b> function or equivalent.  These
draw smooth curves instead of histograms.
</li> <p></p>

<li> To use base R, call <b>plot()</b> on the first curve, then
<b>lines()</b> for each of the rest.  You'll first need to find the max
Y coordinate among all the curves, and set <b>ylim</b> accordingly in
your call to <b>plot()</b>.  You can use 1,2,3,... for the default
colors, or your own choice, but the function must be GENERAL.
</li> <p></p>

<li> Note that this is to be a general function, usable in R in general.
None of the code should be specific to this assignment.
</li> <p></p> 

</ul>

<p></p>


<p></p>
The genres are given in the data as <i>indicator variables,</i> 0s and
1s (called a <i>dummy variable</i> in stat and
econ, and <i>one-hot</i> in machine learning).  You'll need to
convert them.
<p></p>

<p>
With 19 genres, you may find the colors hard to distinguish.  If so,
just do 8 genres.  Also, the fact that some movies are of
multiple genres; the curve for genre i should be based on all movies
having that genre, even though two different curves may be derived from
somewhat overlapping sets of movies.
